.SH NAME
dashboard \- A Text-based User Interface (TUI) for launching homelab scripts.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dashboard.py

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dashboard
is a simple, fast, and efficient TUI for running common homelab scripts and commands. It is built with the Python Textual framework and is designed to be driven entirely by the keyboard.

The menu of available commands is generated dynamically from a MySQL database, allowing for easy customization without modifying the application code. It supports commands that require user input, streaming output for long-running processes, and launching full-screen terminal applications like far2l.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
The application requires Python 3 and several Python libraries (Textual, PyMySQL), which can be installed via the included \fIinstall.sh\fP script. It also requires access to a MySQL database containing the \fIdashboard_commands\fP table.

.SH DATABASE SETUP
The menu is controlled by the \fBdals.dashboard_commands\fP table. This table must be created and populated before running the application. The required schema is:
.P
.B CREATE TABLE `dashboard_commands` (
.br
.B   `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
.br
.B   `key` char(1) NOT NULL,
.br
.B   `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
.br
.B   `command_type` enum('shell','python','internal') NOT NULL,
.br
.B   `command_string` text NOT NULL,
.br
.B   `requires_input` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
.br
.B   `quote_input` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
.br
.B   `enabled` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '1',
.br
.B   PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
.br
.B   UNIQUE KEY `key` (`key`)
.br
.B );
.P
Each row in this table corresponds to a menu item in the dashboard.

.SH USAGE
To run the dashboard, execute the main Python script:
.P
.BR python3 /path/to/project/dashboard.py

.SH KEYBINDINGS
.TP
.B q
Quit the application at any time.
.TP
.B [key]

.SH FILES
.TP

The default project directory containing all application files.
.TP
.I ~/projects/dashboard_v1.0/dashboard.css
The stylesheet that controls the appearance of the TUI.
